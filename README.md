[project 1] Korea Lottery Number Recommendation System

Hi~ I am Say~Lee.<br>
I am a beginner data analyst who has just started learning Python. ðŸ˜€<br>
so plz don't be too hard on me, even if my skills are horrible. ðŸ˜•<br>
I am planning to make posts of my work on Github from now on, plz enjoy it!<br>

My first project is a lottery number recommendation system for the South Korean Lottery system known as 'Lotto'!<br>

While there are already many lottery number recommendation services available in Korea, <br>
Lotto has been subject to suspicions of manipulation. <br>
There are several reasons for this:<br>

1. The first prize winning numbers have never been repeated in history<br>
2. There has never been a time when no one won the prize.<br>

As someone who buys Lotto every week myself, I become curious about whether there might be real manipulation involved.<br>

So I proposed the following approach:<br>

[First] I formulated a hypothesis.<br>
"Lotto is manipulated<br>
This hypothesis incorporates situations where people have raised concerns about manipulation into the code.<br>

(1) all the historical first prize winning numbers are excluded.<br>
(2) Among the numbers with the least number of winners, at least one will be selected as the winning number.<br>

[Second] To achieve this, I simulated the scenario of the first round of Lotto purchases and conducted experiment by:<br>

(1) Generate random number lists as many times as the average number of Lotto purchases for a week.<br>
(2) Delete historical first prize winning numbers<br>
(3) Select the number lists with the lowest duplicate counts.<br>
(4) Randomly sample 5 sets of numbers from the selected lists. <br>

As I am just beginning to study programming, the code may be quite messy.<br>
I used too many for loops, which resulted in long execution times.<br>
<br>
Please don't be too critical ðŸ˜¥<br>
